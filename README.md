# Loop Review

### Exercise 1:
Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.

Hint: Use 'continue' statement. 

Expected Output : 
```0 1 2 4 5```

### Exercise 2:
Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers. 

Sample numbers: ```numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)```

Expected Output : 
```
Number of even numbers : 5
Number of odd numbers : 4
```
### Exercise 3:
Write a Python program that accepts a sequence of lines (blank line to terminate) as input and prints the lines as output after User enters a blank line to end.

Do not use an array to hold the lines of text

Hints: 
You can use ```"\n"``` if you want to add a line break between sentences

Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.
```
